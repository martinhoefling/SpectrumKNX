# Changelog

## 1.7.1

### Added

- **Building Structure**: filter buttons to add all group addresses of a whole device or of a single channel to the target filter, in addition to the existing per-KO and source-PA filters (#119).
- **Traffic Statistics**: the Group Addresses and Physical Addresses tabs are now drill-down trees — expand a GA to see which devices (PAs) sent to it, or expand a PA to see the group addresses it wrote to, each with its share of the traffic (#121).
- Home Assistant add-on icon and logo so the add-on is recognisable in the store and supervisor (#123).

### Changed

- **Building Structure**: the expand/collapse state of the tree is now remembered when leaving and returning to the view (#118).
- **Building Structure**: "Show last seen values" on a communication object now covers all of its connected group addresses instead of only the first one, tagging each row with the matching GA (#120).

### Fixed

- Telegram table: widening the Source and Target columns now reveals more of the device/GA name instead of truncating at a fixed width (#117).
